      <p>Programming was a hobby for me until I decided to make it also
        my everyday work. 15 years of experience in the field of project
        management meant that I am not afraid of large and absorbing
        projects, and I can easily adapt to changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I have completed a eight-month "Python from
        scratch" course where I gained the skills to write clean code in
        this language. Every day I train my skills and improve my
        qualifications through Udemy and creating various projects as a
        hobby. Reply U impresses me with the fact that it is guided by
        innovation in its projects. I would like to associate my future in
        the IT industry with the best with someone like you!
